# Automated Water Filling System

# Description:
This repository houses a project aimed at automating the water filling process using Siemens' TIA Portal. The focus is on creating a streamlined system through a ladder diagram and a user-friendly Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for efficient water level monitoring and control in the reservoir.

# Features:
# Ladder Diagram:
Code developed in Siemens' TIA Portal for fully automating the water filling process.
Systematic ladder logic ensuring precise control.
